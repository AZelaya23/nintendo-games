In this project, I decided I wanted to work on something related to some of my interest. To think of a topic, I decided to take a dataset related to Nintendo video games since it was something I loved growing up. I came across a dataset that had some data related to Nintendo games and decided to work on it.

To start off, I went through and cleaned the game titles that had grammatical errors ins them such as "@s" or "Ã‚" found within certain titles. Cleaning this made it easier to search by title down the line without needing to add those special characters.

Even the initial clean-up, I wanted to separate the genre cloumn into "genre" and "Sub Genre" since many titles have a main genre and a sub genre cateogrized by them. Examples such as "Super Mario Galaxy" is considered a platformer and an Action-Adventure game because of the general platofrming on Mario titles, but also the puzzle solving and "adventure" like characteristics.
